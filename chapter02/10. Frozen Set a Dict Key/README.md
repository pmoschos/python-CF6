# 📂 Python Dictionary Operations Demonstration 🔄

Welcome to the Python Dictionary Operations Demonstration! This script provides an example of using Python dictionaries with diverse key-value pairs, including immutable keys and nested data structures. It’s a great starting point for understanding Python’s flexible and powerful dictionary type.

## Script Overview 📘

The script demonstrates:
- Creating a dictionary with various types of keys and values.
- Using immutable objects (like `frozenset`) as dictionary keys.
- Representing complex data with nested structures.

### 💻 Script Code

```python
# Define a dictionary with diverse key-value pairs
sym = {
    frozenset({1, 2, 3}): "Hello",  # Immutable frozenset as a key
    "key1": "value1",  # String key with string value
    "key2": 10,  # String key with integer value
    3: [1, 2, 3],  # Integer key with list value
    4: {1: "one", 2: "two"}  # Integer key with nested dictionary as value
}

# Print the entire dictionary
print(sym)
```

## Key Features 🌟

- **Diverse Key-Value Pairs**: Learn how dictionaries support keys and values of various types.
- **Immutable Keys**: Understand the use of immutable objects, such as `frozenset`, as dictionary keys.
- **Nested Structures**: Explore how to store nested data structures like lists and dictionaries as values in a dictionary.

## Technical Requirements 🔧

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

## Installation and Setup 🚀

This script can be run directly in any Python environment. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
