# 🔄 Python Nested Loops Demonstration 🔁

Welcome to the Python Nested Loops Demonstration! This script highlights the use of nested loops in Python with a practical example of a multiplication table. It’s a great resource for understanding how loops can work together to solve problems effectively.

## Script Overview 📘

The script demonstrates how to use nested loops to iterate over multiple ranges and perform operations at each iteration, showcasing a multiplication table for different numbers.

### 💻 Script Code

```python
print("Nested loops in Python (multiplication example)")

for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 11):
        print(f"{i} * {j} = {i * j}", end=" | ")
    print()
print()
```

## Key Features 🌟

- **Nested Loops**: Learn how to use loops within loops for iterating over multiple dimensions.
- **Multiplication Table Example**: See a practical application of nested loops to generate a formatted multiplication table.
- **Flexible Ranges**: Understand how ranges can control the number of iterations in each loop.

## Technical Requirements 🔧

- **Python Version**: Python 3.x recommended
- **External Libraries**: None

## Installation and Setup 🚀

This script can be run directly in any Python environment. Follow these steps:

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Save the script as `02_nested_loops_demo.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `02_nested_loops_demo.py`.
5. Run the script with the command: `python 02_nested_loops_demo.py`.

## Usage Example 📋
Executing the script will generate a formatted multiplication table for numbers 1 through 3, each multiplied by numbers 1 through 10. It provides an excellent visualization of nested loop functionality in Python.
